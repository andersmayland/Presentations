This presentation focuses on effective data storytelling and how to incorporate several of its tech-niques into Power BI reports. Data professionals are usually proficient in enlightening their target audiences but fail to engage and explain. This is due to lacking the final part of the data storytelling triad; narrative.
          By incorporating narrative and visual storytelling techniques into Power BI, I demonstrate how resulting reports are more engaging and explanatory, leading to greater adoption and an increased probability of uncovering insights. Using my own experience as a data analyst, along with drawing inspiration from Brent Dykes’s book “Effective Data Storytelling”, we will look at different cases where data storytelling principles may be applied and offer a specialized storytelling toolset to em-power data professionals.
